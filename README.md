# Portfolio Website

This repository contains a simple portfolio website themed in black and white. Open `index.html` in a browser to view it.

To see the behavior, load the file and scroll down the page. The header will stay in place while the footer only appears once you've reached the bottom.

The header remains fixed at the top of the page when scrolling so navigation is always visible. The footer is displayed only once you reach the bottom of the page.

The year shown in the footer updates automatically via JavaScript when the page loads.
